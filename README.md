# Analyzing Chile's Earthquake Data

In this project, we __import, clean and do statistical analysis and visualizations__ of Chile's earthquake data from 
[Centro Sismol√≥gico Nacional](https://www.csn.uchile.cl) (CSN). 
We use two main datasets: Chile's major earthquakes (with magnitude greater than 7) and Chile's significant earthquake events (with magnitude greater or equal to 3).

To run it locally, make sure to do the following:

- Create a python virtual environment
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Open the notebooks in JupyterLab

See also the `chile-major-earthquakes.ipynb` at [nbviewer.org](https://nbviewer.org/github/fabiomnsantos/chile-earthquakes/blob/main/chile-major-earthquakes.ipynb?flush_cache=t) to __display the interactive map__.
