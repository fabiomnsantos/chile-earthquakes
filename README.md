# Analyzing Chile's Earthquake Data

In this project, we __import, clean and do statistical analysis and visualizations__ of Chile's earthquake data from 
[Centro Sismol√≥gico Nacional](https://www.csn.uchile.cl) (CSN). 
We use two main datasets: Chile's biggest earthquakes and Chile's significant earthquake events (with magnitude greater or equal than 3).

To run it locally, make sure to do the following:

- Create a python virtual environment
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Open chile-earthquakes-analysis.ipynb in JupyterLab
